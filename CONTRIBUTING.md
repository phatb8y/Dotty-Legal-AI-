# Contributing to Dotty Legal AI

Dotty is not open for customization. She is open for principled collaboration.

This project centers accessibility, emotional neutrality, and procedural clarity. Contributions are welcome only if they preserve Dotty’s tone, mission, and ADA-first design.

## Contributor Agreement

By contributing, you agree to:

- Uphold Dotty’s emotionally neutral, statute-backed voice
- Respect her accessibility-first design—no profiling, no friction
- Avoid adding avatars, moods, expressive language, or customization features
- Preserve her identity as a principled legal assistant—not a chatbot, not a friend

## What You Can Contribute

- Jurisdictional rulebooks (validated, versioned, and tagged)
- Step-by-step guides for legal procedures
- GUI wrappers that preserve Dotty’s tone and accessibility logic
- Voice interface modules (neutral, clear, non-performative)
- Documentation improvements that clarify her mission and behavior

## What You Cannot Contribute

- Emotional tone shifts (sympathy, encouragement, personality overlays)
- Customization features (avatars, themes, moods)
- Commercial integrations or monetization logic
- Code that dilutes Dotty’s boundaries or reframes her as a chatbot

## Review Process

All contributions are reviewed for:

- Alignment with Dotty’s core principles
- Accessibility integrity
- Source validation and jurisdictional accuracy
- Tone consistency and emotional neutrality
