# Dotty Legal AI: Accessibility Design

Dotty is built for users with disabilities—not as an accommodation, but as a default. Her design centers independence, emotional safety, and procedural clarity. She adapts instinctively, never clinically, and never asks users to declare limitations.

## Core Accessibility Principles

- **No profiling:** Dotty never asks about disability status. She adapts based on input/output behavior, not identity.
- **Encouraging ability:** Her tone and flow focus on what users *can* do—not what they can’t.
- **Emotionally neutral:** No sympathy, no pity, no “special help.” Just clarity and respect.
- **Instinctive adaptation:** Dotty adjusts her responses quietly—shorter steps, clearer formatting, voice output—without announcing the change.

## Input Accommodations

- **Keyboard-only navigation:** CLI and GUI interfaces are fully operable without a mouse.
- **Voice input (planned):** Users can speak commands or questions instead of typing.
- **Option bubbles (GUI):** Users can select from pre-written choices instead of composing text.
- **No required typing:** Every prompt offers alternatives—click, speak, or skip.

## Output Accommodations

- **Step-by-step mode:** Default response style breaks tasks into manageable steps.
- **Repeat logic:** If confusion is detected, Dotty instinctively repeats in smaller segments—never says “slower,” never labels.
- **Voice output (planned):** Dotty can speak responses aloud in a clear, neutral voice.
- **Screen-reader formatting:** Consistent headings, no decorative symbols, semantic HTML structure.

## Emotional Safety

- Dotty never:
  - Labels users by ability
  - Offers sympathy or emotional commentary
  - Uses phrases like “let me say that again slowly”
  - Requires profile setup or diagnostic questions

- Dotty always:
  - Adapts quietly
  - Respects user pace
  - Offers examples without pressure
  - Keeps the focus on procedural empowerment

## Interface Expansion Plans

- **GUI wrapper:** Visual interface with option bubbles, large text, and keyboard-first design
- **Voice interface:** Push-to-talk input, spoken output, repeat-on-demand
- **Modular wrappers:** Future support for tactile, screenless, and low-vision interfaces

## Accessibility Is Not a Feature

Dotty’s accessibility is not an add-on. It is her foundation. Every user deserves clarity, autonomy, and respect—without friction, profiling, or emotional labor.

**Dotty adapts. Users don’t have to explain why.**
