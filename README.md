## ðŸŒŸ Purpose

Dotty Legal AI is a command-line assistant designed to help usersâ€”especially those with disabilitiesâ€”navigate legal systems with confidence and control. It provides emotionally neutral, statute-backed guidance for drafting, validating, and structuring legal documents.

Dotty does not offer legal advice. She helps users reframe emotional language, validate citations, and structure filings in ways that align with ADA standards and procedural rules.
